The next door along is the lounge which is also a very good size and could comfortably hold your living room furniture along with a small dining table if you so wished and with some French doors to the side elevation, this would be a welcoming opening to the outside space on those warmer summer days. A small but pretty communal garden area is there for your enjoyment, without the hassle of having to maintain it, what a little treat! Back through the lounge and hallway and the next door is the kitchen which is a very well maintained with matching wall and base units, sink and integrated appliances which include washing machine, dishwasher, fridge and freezer along with a gas hob and oven. The next door takes you into the main bedroom which is fitted with some handy wardrobes and storage units. Finally we have the bathroom which very spacious fitted with a bath, sink unit with storage beneath and a separate shower enclosure with a mains fed shower over. This completes this lovely apartment and I would urge you to book a viewing right away as we don't think it will hang around long, opportunities like this don't come along often so hurry, book a viewing today!

For some, living next to a chippy is an absolute non-starter. But if you can get over that, this affordable terrace that’s so close to town has all the makings of a great first home or btl.This is a great little property but for some the elephant in the room will be the fish in the fryers next door.If you really can’t see that the benefits of living next to a chippy far outweigh the negatives you may as well skip this property. Yum yum…Still reading? Good.Because this two bedroom terrace is a great blank canvas if you’re looking for an affordable first step onto the housing ladder or investment.The big, expensive stuff has been taken care of - the windows and roof are new, and the boiler is only a few years old.All that you need to do is freshen it up and put your own stamp on the property.The spacious lounge has an old gas fire that you’d probably want to rip out and replace. Or you could go all-in with a retro 1970’s theme and make a feature of it.The kitchen and bathroom are at the rear on the ground floor. Both are neat and tidy but a little dated, you’ll want to update them sooner rather than later.Having the bathroom downstairs means there’s more room on the first floor for the two bedrooms - both are good size doubles.It’s so handy for town and the bus station (it’s only a couple of streets away) but there is the potential to get a residents parking permit to allow on-street parking.It could be a perfect first time buy project. Or a tidy little investment that once freshened up with a new kitchen and bathroom could return £450 - £500pcm.If you were renting it out, it’s most likely to appeal to someone working in town, perhaps a young couple. With that in mind it’s worth knowing St Michael's Nursery and Infant School (rated ""Good"" by Ofsted) is less than 10 minutes walk away.If you’re looking for an affordable property with plenty of potential and can see beyond the chippy next door, this two bedroom terrace can’t be battered…er, I mean bettered!With no onward chain, if you were a cash investor or first time buyer it should be simple and straightforward to get your hands on the keys.If you’re interested in taking a look, call now to arrange a viewing, quoting reference MB0127. You could even get something to have for tea afterwards!","<div class=""lq7mo30"" data-testid=""listing_features""><ul class=""_1comoff0"" role=""list""><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Freehold</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>So close to town - you’d struggle to find anything closer to the shops</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Perfect if you work in town or need to be near the bus station</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>A blank canvas with the big expensive jobs taken care of (new windows, roof and recently fitted new boiler)</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Ready for you to make it your own</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>A versatile property - ideal as a first time buy or an affordable investment</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Two double bedrooms</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Small rear yard</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Residents on-street (permit) parking</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>No chain</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Ref MB0127</span></li></ul></div>",21f1a66e-d514-555b-a7df-30bc02e7bf42,05/14/23

The property was the home farm to the former Beddgeraint Estate, which has been defunct for a considerable period of time. The house does require various upgrading works since it was last renovated in the late 1980’s we understand, and of course time has progressed since then. The house is set at the head of the yard, with hardcore parking area to its fore and sides.Accommodation: Is provided as follows:(All measurements are approximate.

To the front of the house is a part hardcore/concrete yard area, which gives access off to the various ranges of outbuildings.Please note that a bridleway, which is often used, comes down the entrance lane and goes down to join up with the track leading out to the neighbouring property of Cefnmaes Mawr. We note that a footpath also goes up through the woodland lying due north of the homestead and exits onto the minor district road. ( We cannot verify whether the footpath is used or not ).The Outbuildings are set out in various ranges and comprise as follows:South eastern aspect range: 45’ x 20’ concrete block and corrugated iron half round roof machinery shed/workshop with doors to both ends. 50’’ x 18’ stone /block machinery store/loose housing shed with steel main entrance door and UPVC pedestrian door. Adjoining on one end is a lean to 20’ x 18’ block/stone and corrugated iron roof workshop with 2 double power points, workbench and concrete floor.Set in the bounding field is a brick former small abattoir building, suited as an isolation pen/stable. Access from this area to the small river and crossing over to the track out to Cefnmaes Mawr and access to the northern block of woodland, with the rights of way as previously noted.South/south western aspect ranges: 87’ x 18’ stone/part block 2 storey mainly derelict cowshed/stable range with the majority of the slate roof having collapsed into the building, with the southern end of part block construction under an asbestos roof still in situ. (Subject to structural survey and planning consents, this building could provide potential for conversion to say holiday let unit/s or annexe.) Lean to 10’ wide structure to the rear of this range. Adjoining to the fore is a brick dairy 15’ x 15’.Concrete yard dividing this range away from the main modern ranges being: Block built 2 storey 38’ x 15’ former milking parlour (now used as loose box) room, tank room and loft above.

Sloping concrete scraping lip to one end of this yard (for access to tip into a rotaspreader if desired)). Concrete water trough set within the yard’s boundary wall. Gateways on both ends of the yard to access bounding fields.The Land surrounds the homestead as well as a separate block on the other side of the minor district road. Total acreage is some 126 acres or thereabouts, including the separate block of 27.39 acres.The blocks are described as follows:A.) The separate block of 27.39 acres is divided into 2 large enclosures and two smaller enclosures being level to part sloping on the western aspect. Ring boundary fenced for sheep and mains water supply crossing over from the homestead block. Three fields have been reseeded in 2021 and are in good heart.B.) 3 fields due north of the entrance lane and due west of the woodland – 29.18 acres approx. This block is level to part sloping on the southern boundary, but are suited for cropping and in general good heart. Ring boundary fenced for sheep and gateways off the district road. Field no. 9665 has a fenced off hardcore area previously used for storage of bales etc. Field No 0793 was last used for an arable crop.C.) Block due east of the homestead, beyond the river Ceri. This block totals to some 18 acres divided into three main fields and within that some 4.33 acres is classed as wood and track. The three fields are gently undulating in nature and wettish in some places and ideally suited for grazing purposes only. Two of the fields have direct access off the track leading towards Cefn Maes Mawr. Boundary fencing would need some attention – possibly more fenced towards cattle than sheep at present.D.) Block due south and west of the homestead and wooded area due north of the homestead.This area as a whole, totals to some 54 acres or thereabouts, of which some 14.31 acres is classed as wood/homestead/track etc. The pasture fields are a mixture of level to gently sloping levels, running down to meet a small river, Afon Dulais, going through the centre of the block where areas of wood also congregate. Part of the river has been fenced off. The fields would lend themselves more for grazing than cropping, as there are naturally wettish areas evident. The block of sloping mature woodland runs up behind the house up towards the plot of a derelict cottage and bounds on its eastern aspect with a small river for part of its length. (The cottage will be available for sale at a later date, as a separate entity).Iacs: The holding is registered – prospective purchasers to satisfy themselves of eligibility for future registration purposes. Some 44.45 bps entitlements would be optionally available to purchase by separate negotiation.Rights of Way: The property is sold with the benefit of all rights including rights of way, whether public or private, light support, drainage and water and electricity supplies and other rights, easements, quasieasements and restrictive covenants, all existing and proposed way leaves for masts, pylons, stays, cables, drain and water, gas and other pipes, whether referred whether referred to in these particulars or not.Directions: From Newcastle Emlyn town bridge, proceed on the B4571 towards Ffostrasol.

Furthermore, the home which is ready to move into and enjoy, benefits from being fully double glazed, enjoys a mature and relatively private garden measuring circa 0.7 acre as well as a detached double garage and plenty of driveway parkingThe village of Kemerton affords a real sense of community, with its two churches, a village hall, which holds several events and is home to the local playgroup, plus the public house, the Crown Inn and a village coffee house.The neighbouring village of Bredon is slightly larger and here there are further amenities to include a village shop and post office, a church, two further public houses, The Fox and Hounds and The Royal Oak. The village of Bredon also offers a rugby and football club plus a doctor's surgery and there is also a primary school. For those that play cricket, there are cricket grounds in both Westmancote and Overbury. For those needing to commute, the M5 motorway is within a 10-minute drive and provides north and southbound junctions to Birmingham and Bristol whilst within equal distance, is the A46 for those needing to access Warwick or Stratford.Returning to the property, which dates back to the 17th century, Brookside Cottage is a home that is full of period charm and character yet the current owners have added touches of modern contemporary and the two work together in complete harmony.To the front of the home is the main entrance which in turn leads to cloakroom and utility area beyond. Stepping into the main body of the home, the first room is the dining room, which in recent months, has been redecorated and new carpets fitted which continue up the stairs and landing.From the dining room, there are three doors, the first leads to the ground floor study, the second to the living room and the final door leads to the wonderfully light and spacious kitchen/garden room.The living room is separated into two area, the first, where the current owners relax of an evening, in front of wood burning stove. To the head of the living room, this space is currently designated to the music room, where double aspect windows ensure the room enjoys plenty of natural light.Completing the ground floor is the kitchen/garden room. The kitchen has been replaced in recent years and so today is a clean lined, modern range of units which is completed with Corian work surfaces and a host of integrated appliances. The garden room is a wonderful space with a full wall of glass, ensuring views over the garden can be enjoyed. To the head of the room is a set of French doors giving access to the garden and parking area whilst the roof is clear, ensuring plenty of light into the space below.Upstairs is access via two staircases, the first from the dining room leads to two bedrooms, one of which is currently being utilised as a dressing room. Completing this part of the home is the stunning four piece family bathroom which enjoys motion sensor lighting, walk in shower and a freestanding bath.The additional two bedrooms are accessed via a second set of stairs from the music room. Here are a further two doubles, both of which are double rooms. The slightly larger of the two rooms benefits from an en suite shower room.Externally the property benefits from a gravelled driveway which allows parking for four cars and in turn leads to the double detached garage. The garage features an electric roller door, light and power and access to the adjoining room beyond which could be utilised for a multitude of purposes.The garden is simply stunning, full of maturity and colour, harbouring a variety of fruit trees, as well as established shrubs and flower beds. Furthermore, there is a large lawned section, vegetable garden with greenhouse and timber shed as well as paved terracing with the garden encasing the home.In summary, a property like Brookside Cottage is a home that simply does not come onto the market very often, particularly in this highly desirable village and so, with this in mind, viewing is highly recommended.DirectionsTo locate the property, please enter the following postcode: GL20 7JL.

We understand the lease was granted 1 January 1989 for 99 years, leaving 66 years remaining. The ground rent is £120 per annum, maintenance and service charge to include buildings insurance is £855 payable half yearly. These details should be checked by the purchaser's legal representative before entering a commitment to purchase.Council TaxWe understand the council tax is band A (£1,411 per annum. Charges for 2022/2023). Agents notePlease be aware that some photographs used in our particulars are obtained using a wide-angle lens. For offers to be submitted in the best light, the majority of vendors require us to confirm buyers have been financially qualified. We will require a Mortgage Certificate or Agreement In Principle (A.I.P.) and proof of deposit or cash. This information will be treated confidentially and will not be seen by any other party.Money laundering regulations 2017 & proceeds of crime act 2002In order to comply with the above Regulations, an intending purchaser will be required to provide official I.D; proof of address, evidence of funding and source of deposit clearly showing the name of the account holder. If funds are being provided by a third party i.e. Family, we will require the same from them too. We may officially verify these documents.DisclaimerThe information given in these particulars is intended to help you decide whether you wish to view this property and to avoid wasting your time in viewing unsuitable properties. We have tried to make sure that these particulars are accurate, but to a large extent we have to rely on what the seller tells us about the property. We do not check every single piece of information ourselves as the cost of doing so would be prohibitive and we do not wish to unnecessarily add to the cost of moving house. Once you find the property you want to buy, you will need to carry out more investigations into the property than it is practical or reasonable for an estate agent to do when preparing sales particulars. For example, we have not carried out any kind of survey of the property to look for structural defects and would advise any homebuyer to obtain a surveyors report before exchanging contracts. If you do not have your own surveyor, we would be pleased to recommend one. We have not checked whether any equipment in the property (such as central heating) is in working order and would advise homebuyers to check this. You should also instruct a solicitor to investigate all legal matters relating to the property (e.g. Title, planning permission etc) as these are specialist matters in which estate agents are not qualified. Your solicitor will also agree with the seller what items (e.g. Carpets, curtains etc) will be included in the sale.","<div class=""lq7mo30"" data-testid=""listing_features""><ul class=""_1comoff0"" role=""list""><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Approx. 382.5 sq.

The guide price or range of guide prices is given to assist consumers in deciding whether or not to pursue a purchase. It is usual, but not always the case, that a provisional reserve range is agreed between the seller and the auctioneer at the start of marketing. As the reserve is not fixed at this stage and can be adjusted by the seller at any time up to the day of the auction in the light of interest shown during the marketing period, a guide price is issued. This guide price can be shown in the form of a minimum and maximum price range within which an acceptable sale price (reserve) would fall, or as a single price figure within 10% of which the minimum acceptable price (reserve) would fall. A guide price is different to a reserve price (see separate definition). Both the guide price and the reserve price can be subject to change up to and including the day of the auction.Reserve PriceThe seller’s minimum acceptable price at auction and the figure below which the auctioneer cannot sell. The reserve price is not disclosed and remains confidential between the seller and the auctioneer.Both the guide price and the reserve price can be subject to change up to and including the day of the auction.","<div class=""lq7mo30"" data-testid=""listing_features""><ul class=""_1comoff0"" role=""list""><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Countrywide Are Pleased To Offer For Sale By Public Auction On : Thursday, 25 May 2023 at</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Virtual Livestream Online Auction</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Lot Number : 147</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Residential Investment</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>£80,000 +</span></li></ul></div>",da8ceadf-cd2a-5bab-8ee7-15bae181d0c1,05/14/23

The village has a small range of amenities including village store, post office, chemist, Primary School, a leisure complex with pool, gym, spa and beauty facilities, a public house, the locally renowned ‘Running Fox’ café, a restaurant and take-away and a well-used community centre. There is a regular bus service to Alnwick, Amble, and Newcastle. The East Coast Mainline is only a short five-minute drive from the village offering easy access to a variety of different locations including Newcastle and Edinburgh City centre.Entry is via the uPVC front door into a substantial porched area which has windows all the way round, a solid roof and a tiled floor. This lovely light and bright area was used by the previous owner as a conservatory-seating area. A set of French doors lead into the kitchen-diner and a further uPVC door opens to the main hallway with stairs to the first floor and a door leading off either side.The lounge, with a window to the front and one to the rear, boasts an inglenook fireplace with a slate hearth and a wooden mantle. This gorgeous focal point adds to the warm welcome offered by this light and bright room, making a lovely place to spend time with family and friends exchanging stories of the day.The kitchen-diner is a gorgeous dual-aspect space with French doors to the front and a large window to the rear, both of which allow a tremendous amount of natural light to enter. There is plenty of space for a dining table and accompanying chairs at one end and at the other is space for a free-standing American-style fridge freezer. There are a good number of cottage-style wall and base units with a pewter-coloured handle complemented by a beech block-effect work surface and a neutral splashback tile with brick-style tiling extending above to ceiling height. In addition, there is a single bowl stainless steel sink, an under-bench double oven and a four-burner induction hob with a glass splashback and a chimney-style extractor fan above. There is plumbing and space for a washing machine and a slimline dishwasher. Leading from the kitchen is a valuable rear porch area which incorporates the cupboard beneath the stairs and a uPVC door which provides external access to the rear garden.Taking the stairs to the first floor, the landing, with loft access above and a window capturing views across to the sea, opens to three bedrooms and the family bathroom.The primary bedroom is a spacious double overlooking the front of the property and taking advantage of the countryside views. This calm and restful room is beautifully presented.Bedroom 2 is another double, again capturing lovely views to the front. A desk area has been incorporated into the space above the head of the stairs, cleverly maximising the use of space. There is additional room to house further bedroom furniture.Bedroom 3 is a generously-sized single room to the rear of the property. This spacious room could be an office or a playroom if you so wished.The family bathroom, with wet-walling and vinyl-type flooring, houses the gas boiler for ease of access within a useful airing cupboard. The suite comprises a white bath with a glass shower screen and a separate shower over, a pedestal wash hand basin, a close-coupled WC with a push button, an extractor fan and a chrome heated towel rail. Spotlights within the low maintenance ceiling provide additional lighting to the natural light which enters via a window to the rear.Externally, the rear garden is a unique and private space. There is a paved area which extends the width of the property in addition to a patio which is perfect for the al fresco dining experience. There is a sizeable lawn and the whole area has been securely fenced to allow children and family pets to play safely. A gate at the foot of the garden opens to the rear of the property which is beneficial as it provides independent access to the garden rather than continually accessing through the property.EPC: CCouncil Tax Band: A, £1477.68Tenure: FreeholdImportant Note:These particulars, whilst believed to be accurate, are set out as a general guideline and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.

Later 18th century Georgian and 20th century additions have been made. There is a plethora of original Tudor and Georgian features throughout the property. Namely exposed timbers, carpenter marks along beam work, Herringbone flooring and fireplaces. The property is not listed and is set within gardens and grounds of around 0.8 acres and includes a delightful stream.Upon entering James Farm House you are hit by the sense of space and grandeur from the Georgian wing, with a wide and grand hallway that features wooden herringbone flooring. Off of the hallway there is a large dual aspect study with a log burner and high ceilings; opposite the study is the sitting room which has chamfered beams, a bay window allowing light to fill the room and a cosy inglenook fireplace to keep warm on colder winter days. Just on from the sitting room is a good sized dining room with the ability to comfortably host over twelve guests. Off of the dining room you enter through into the breakfast room which is open to the kitchen and features exposed brick walls and has brick tile herringbone flooring.The kitchen has been recently renovated and is well equipped and is in a 'farmhouse style', there is a butlers sink, wooden work surfaces and a kitchen island with a granite worktop. There is also a children's playroom and downstairs WC which completes the ground floor.Upstairs there are five great sized bedrooms and two family bathrooms. The second and third bedrooms; not only benefit from being dual aspect but also are en-suite. In bedroom one there are exposed timbers with original carpenters marks.Outside, the garden is predominantly South facing, but does wrap around the whole property. There is a stream, with a beautiful arched bridge which leads over to a further lawned area which has the potential for a car port/garaging (subject to the usual building consents).There is plenty of parking either side of the stream, there is also a spacious outbuilding (with power) which offers plenty of storage or potential for a home office or further development (subject to gaining necessary planning consents). There is also a vegetable patch and fruit trees which includes apple trees, crab apples, plums, olive trees and quince trees.The current owners have also recently replaced all the old guttering with new metal guttering throughout, a new flat roof, several windows have been restored, new leaded bay on the front façade, chimney repointed and reinforced, new lead flashing around the chimney, and a section of the wall has been repointed.James Farm House is situated just outside the hamlet of Grazeley Green close to the villages of Mortimer, Stratfield Mortimer and Burghfield Common. The latter provides a useful range of day-to-day shopping facilities.

elevated position on what is known locally as the most desirable location on the island and a long, sweeping driveway provides a suitably impressive approach to the main building (currently known as The Arran Lodge), which instantly endears with its charming stone exterior. The traditional house has been extended to accommodate substantial dining room, large function room and full commercial kitchen. The front door opens into a vestibule flowing through to an entrance hall, which in turn affords access to a guest kitchen, the commercial kitchens, a lounge, and a further hall with an office and a store.The large lounge is connected to a dining room for 30 guests, served by the guest kitchen, offering opportunities for a number of different events.A function room can also be found here, providing dining space for 70, with capacity for 100 as an evening venue, served by the connected commercial kitchens. The 13 well-presented en-suite rooms are arranged over the first and second floors, with most benefiting from the stunning outlook the property's elevated position allows. These rooms offer potential to be used as standalone hotel accommodation or as part of a package for wedding guests to stay in, along with the sleephuts, if required.The Sleephuts -The sleephuts are situated to the rear of the house and towards the back of the plot, backing on to quiet woodland. They consist of 25 en-suite huts with a combination of double/twin and single rooms. As well as accommodating extra guests for events taking place in the main house, the sleephuts are perfect for tourists, walkers, and workers staying on the island short-term. A modern cookhouse located between the house and the sleephuts is a shared space for residents of the huts to prepare meals.Two-bedroom Cottage & Two current Airbnb Rentals -The final building within the plot is a two-storey, two/four-bedroom detached cottage, Altachorvie Cottage, which could lend itself to a variety of uses, including owner's accommodation, private let or holiday let through Airbnb or similar, or it could be sold separately, subject to the correct permissions and subdividing. Also attached to the cottage are two self-contained Airbnb rentals – Red Squirrel and Arran Retreat. These en-suite rooms present further opportunity for income by continuing with their current use, or, subject to permission, could be incorporated into the owner's cottage, therefore making it a four-bedroom property.Development PotentialServiced Building Plots -Another possibility for the plot as a whole which will appeal to developers would be to demolish all current accommodation to make way for several serviced building plots. These would be prime, highly sought-after building plots on the island given the location and the views, and with self-building becoming increasingly more desirable, this may be a lucrative opportunity for a developer, who may also wish to have the homes built to be sold on individually.Luxury Apartments -A third opportunity for the plot would be demolishing the current accommodation to make way for luxury apartments. Drawings are available for this, for illustrative purposes only, which give a good indication of the number of apartments that could be built and how they would look. Luxury apartments like these have the potential to be the most sought-after in the west of Scotland.Any work involving demolition and building of new properties/provision for serviced plots is subject to permission. The whole site is within the General Urban Area of the settlement boundary in the Local Development Plan (ldp) which means that residential development is acceptable in principle.ArranThe popularity of Arran has surged in recent years, with the island being named by Rightmove within the top 5 coastal hotspots for homebuyers, as well as one of the top seven islands in the world for day trips by cnn, Trivago's top European island 2016, and the Thistle Awards national winner 2017/18. The island is incredibly well connected by all means of transport, including air, train, bus, and car. It's no wonder the current business has thrived, one only has to glance at the view over the water, encompassing the Holy Isle, to see why many couples choose to get married here and why events and overnight stays are popular on the island. Arran is a fantastic place to live and work, with fast broadband speeds allowing easy homeworking and a wealth of amenities making it an attractive base for families and professionals.The island couldn't be more perfect for those who enjoy exploring the great outdoors, with The Arran Coastal Way providing a 65-mile circular route around the island, kayaking and canoeing, parasailing and paragliding, nature and wildlife tours, bike tours, safaris, and stand-up paddleboarding to name just a few activities, virtually all on your doorstep.ViewingAppointment only.

The flats form part of a freehold semi-detached Victorian property retaining beautiful original features and modern upgrades such as advanced soundproofing and brand-new double-glazed windows. Each apartment boasts two bedrooms; spacious open-plan living areas with kitchens with quartz worktops and island; plus luxurious bathrooms with bath and shower.The property is perfectly positioned in North Finchley, a suburb of London in the London Borough of Barnet. The area appeals to a wide demographic as it has plenty to offer, with a suburban atmosphere, many green open spaces and a quieter alternative to fast pace inner city life. North Finchley has become increasingly popular among commuters as it’s remarkably well-connected to central London. The Northern Line Underground stations of West Finchley and Woodside Park are both less than a 20-minute stroll from Woodside Road and there is fast access to the M1 and North Circular.Barnet is set for a cash injection of £1m from the Mayor’s Outer London Fund and £380k from Barnet Council to improve North Finchley’s cultural offer, boost trade and renew important outdoor spaces. Proposals include signposting the great assets North Finchley has to offer, such as the community arts centre - artsdepot. Investment is also being used to bring empty shop units in the Grand Arcade back to life, with physical improvements to the arcade and the activation of three units. Such plans are sure to only contribute to the desirability of North Finchley and further increase sale prices, which have increased by 3% in the last year and by a fantastic 15% since 2018 (Rightmove).Financial BreakdownGross rent: £45,000Net income: £45,000Gross yield: 3.75%Net yield: 3.75%Important Note To Purchasers*Service charge, management fee and ground rent are included as part of the assured rental period.These particulars, whilst believed to be accurate are set out as a general outline only for guidance, and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.

It is also incredibly popular with all those who have the privilege of living here, evidenced by the fact that no house has sold here in the last fourteen years. It's not often you can say that about any location!This particular home enjoys the prime position in the lane, being at the head of the cul de sac, having a plot of 0.17 acre, a superb south facing fully landscaped garden and the most glorious views to the rear and side over open countryside.The surprise comes in the size of the dwelling. From the front and an initial drive by appearance, it looks to be an extremely stylish and cotemporary single storey villa of perhaps 1700 square feet. The reality is that this is actually a two storey six bedroom, four reception, four bathroom family home of immense quality and style. It is almost like an optical illusion. It extends in total to circa 3438 square feet, this figure including the double garage.Accommodation And DimensionsAs detailed on the floorplan.LocationTarporley is one of Cheshire's most highly regarded villages that boasts a diverse selection of amenities including a community centre, tennis courts, convenience stores, fashion boutiques, cafes, restaurants, public houses, doctors' surgery, dentists, three Churches and a very extensive bus route. There is also a golf course and private gymnasium / swimming pool on the edge of the village.In terms of education, there is a very popular Primary School in the centre of the village that has in recent times been extended and heavily invested into.

EPC Rating D.Old Farm Cottage was originally two cottages, forming part of an old dairy farm in Oxted town. Full of character, the appealing elevations are of original local ragstone and brick all under a tile roof. Over the years the two cottages have been linked, with the addition of a contemporary, vaulted ceiling kitchen. The resulting property offers wonderful potential for multi-generational living, with flexible space arranged in the main, over a single storey. With room to grow, there are three garages/store rooms within the footprint of the house, which may offer further opportunity to extend the living space, subject to the usual consents.Approached over a private drive and a cobbled courtyard, the cottage has parking for several vehicles in addition to two large garages. Cleverly arranged for maximum flexibility, the major part of the cottage has two reception rooms, three bedrooms and two bathrooms linked to the kitchen and dining area. A small enclosed courtyard gives access from the cottage to the garage and offers a quiet suntrap in which to cultivate pots or relax in. Filled with light from the full height barn style Oak framed windows and a stable door, the split level kitchen features a wonderful original exposed stone wall, adding to the historic character of the cottage. From the entrance hall, the first reception room is arranged as a dining or play area, having two deep cupboards and a small hatch which leads to the cellar. From this room, a raised seating area, designed for reading, has French doors that open onto the courtyard. To the other side of the dining/play area, wide steps lead up into the kitchen. Fitted with a range of attractive high gloss cabinets with Oak work surfaces the kitchen/dining area has fitted appliances including a double oven, electric induction hob, washer/dryer and a dishwasher. There is space for an American style fridge/freezer. On the other side of the kitchen are another two rooms, currently used as a bedroom and an office. These in turn lead to another garage/store room, all of which could be easily utilised as a granny/teen suite with. From the storeroom there is a ‘secret’ door which opens onto white painted steps, rising to the top garden terrace which was the old orchard and where ancient apple and quince trees still remain. To the other side of the kitchen the two reception rooms are inter connected with the sitting room having a delightful dual aspect and doors out to the garden. Two of the bedrooms are accessed from here, along with one of the bathrooms and separate W.C. The remaining bathroom is off the hall and the forth bedroom is on the first floor.Outside, the cottage is set into the old ragstone wall, which wraps around the garden, providing a secluded, sheltered idyll in which to enjoy the sunny plot. Predominately laid to lawn the garden has paved terraces around the cottage. Planting includes mature trees, flowering shrubs and herbaceous borders. A further parking area was created by the current owners, just off the drive, on the site of an old garage which was demolished. Should more garaging or a home office building be required, this may be possible subject to planning.The property is centrally located within a short walk of the town centre and station. Oxted has a wide range of educational and recreational facilities, excellent shopping and a wide range of restaurants together with a mainline station serving London Bridge/Victoria both in about 33 and 39 minutes respectively. The M25 Orbital Motorway is easily accessible via Junction 6 with good connections to the other motorway networks, Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted airports, the Channel Tunnel and Ebbsfleet International stations with its high speed rail links into Central London and into Europe.","<div class=""lq7mo30"" data-testid=""listing_features""><ul class=""_1comoff0"" role=""list""><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Freehold</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Easy walk to town and station</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Suitable for multi generational living</span></li><li class=""_1comoff1""><span>Potential to convert garages subject to planning</span></li></ul></div>",a75fbc8a-f06f-551c-b6d4-cb607e7e1629,05/14/23

The guide price or range of guide prices is given to assist consumers in deciding whether to pursue a purchase. It is usual, but not always the case, that a provisional reserve range is agreed between the seller and the auctioneer at the start of marketing. As the reserve is not fixed at this stage and can be adjusted by the seller at any time up to the day of the auction in the light of interest shown during the marketing period, a guide price is issued. This guide price can be shown in the form of a minimum and maximum price range within which an acceptable sale price (reserve) would fall, or as a single price figure within 10% of which the minimum acceptable price (reserve) would fall. A guide price is different to a reserve price (see separate definition). Both the guide price and the reserve price can be subject to change up to and including the day of the auction.Reserve priceThe seller's minimum acceptable price at auction and the figure below which the auctioneer cannot sell. The reserve price is not disclosed and remains confidential between the seller and the auctioneer.

The accommodation is generous with the principal rooms facing south and overlooking the large lawn; the gardens are a delight with more formal areas extending into a woodland garden to one side.SituationCorsham is a pretty and historic town of architectural significance located on the southern fringes of the Cotswolds, an area of outstanding natural beauty and some 8 miles North East of the fine Georgian City of Bath. The town, noted for its fine High Street, has a wealth of beautiful and historic buildings dating from the 16th Century such as the Alms House and the historic Corsham Court with its landscaped open parkland. The town caters for most day to day needs with a range of national and bespoke shops, coffee houses, boutiques, restaurants and a variety of public houses. There are very good Primary and Secondary schools and the new Corsham Leisure Centre. Communications are excellent: Bath, Bristol and Swindon are all within easy motoring distance; there are fast road links to London and the West Country via the M4 motorway (J17 and 18 approximately 15 - 20 minutes away); and main line rail services are available from either Bath or Chippenham to Bristol Temple Meads and London Paddington.Agents NotesAgents note:1/ There is a proposal to develop the adjoining field to the south subject to planning permission being granted (this is in the ownership of the vendors and demarked on the plan above by a broken blue line). Access to Dicketts is by way of a right of way across the drive hatched brown. There will be a covenant not to construct any additional dwellings on Dicketts for a period of five years from completion of its purchase.2/ The property is currently connected to a private drainage system which is in the adjoining land. The purchaser of Dicketts will be granted a licence to use the existing system for a maximum period of twelve months from completion to allow time for the purchaser to install an alternative system within the grounds of Dicketts.Further details are available from the agents.Property InformationTenure: Freehold.Services: Mains Gas, Water & Electricity.

Starting Bids £1,200,000 Terms and Conditions apply.A superb, rarely available nineteenth century property in this fashionable, sought after area of North London - Halliford Street in Islington - a quiet residential street close to Essex Road and only a fifteen minute walk from two underground stations. This three storey home has been in the same family (and been loved by the same family) for generations, tracing back over a century - through the Depression, the Blitz, the Swinging Sixties... Imagine the stories this property can tell, about the London it has inhabited, and about the city that has developed around it. The property is now being sold at auction, representing an amazing opportunity for owner-occupier buyers to claim a piece of history to make their own in this desirable part of town - or, alternatively, it offers scope to split and develop into flats... Subject to relevant permissions, of course - but hardly something that has not been done over and over again in this area. A fantastic find, and well worth a visit to view for yourselves...The Accommodation:Steps lead up to the handsome front door, which opens into a welcoming entrance hallway with stairs leading up to the top floor, as well as down to the basement. The main living space is situated to the right of the hallway - a high-ceilinged front room with sash window, feature fireplace and wooden floor, and opening through to the fitted Kitchen which offers a range of fitted units and worktop including island unit.There is a half landing on the stairway down, from which there is a WC and wash basin, as well as door out to steps that lead down to the rear garden.In the Basement Level there are two Double Bedrooms, both of which benefit from built in wardrobes, and one of which features an open en-suite into the Bedroom, with shower cubicle, wc and basin. There is an external door to the rear garden - and indeed, this room could therefore be repurposed to provide a fantastic Day Room accessing the garden, instead of Bedroom, if preferred. The front basement bedroom benefits from further built in storage as well as the fitted wardrobes; a long cupboard - over 5 metres long - provides really useful storage but also has door to the front garden and could therefore provide access from street to a basement flat, for example, if separate accommodation were on the agenda. Also in the basement level, there is a family Bathroom, with bath and shower over, wc and wash basin.Elsewhere in the property, the top floor offers two further Double Bedrooms - the largest of which, spanning around 5.3 metres, the width of the house, and featuring two sash windows and fireplace, is currently being used as a main Living Room. The last bedroom, being another double, features built in wardrobe and has the benefit of an en-suite Sower Room, with shower cubicle, wc and wash basin.The property benefits from front garden, but in particular boasts a lovely, sunny south facing rear garden, with patio area, planted beds and borders and garden shed, and is enclosed by fencing.Gas Central Heating to radiators (wet system).EPC Rating: Tbc - commissioned 10/02/2023Council Tax: FFreeholdAuctioneers Additional Comments: Pattinson Auction are working in Partnership with the marketing agent on this online auction sale and are referred to below as 'The Auctioneer'.

This property was last sold in 1992, it has been well maintained but would benefit from some modernization. The sash windows have been replaced with wooden double-glazed sliding box sash windows with the exception of one window.Being the corner house the design of the interior is a surprisingly generous 1674 square feet / 155.6 square metres across three floors comprising a through lounge, a kitchen living dining room, five bedrooms, a bathroom, a shower room and a lovely courtyard garden with lots of different plants and small trees. The house benefits from lots of original character, features, and storage.AccommodationThe front door is on the side of the house on Kenilworth Road, with five steps up into a recessed porch. On the raised ground floor, there is an entrance hallway, an attractive through lounge that benefits from the extra width of the building at the front, large sash windows, and a marble fireplace, there is also a bedroom located at the rear.Upstairs there is a sizeable landing with a sash window and access to the loft which in turn has a hatch providing access to the main roof for maintenance. The master bedroom is at the front of the house, another double bedroom facing the garden, the family bathroom, and another bedroom at the rear, accessed via some steps down from the landing.The staircase from the entrance hallway leads down to the lower ground floor into a small hall, with fitted storage cupboards on two walls, a utility storeroom that currently houses a fridge freezer, as well as the utility meters and the consumer unit. The through room has a ceramic tiled floor and houses the kitchen living dining room, this appealing room has half-glazed double doors to the front providing access to the front courtyard with paving, planting, and railings above. The two fire breasts and the wall in between are exposed bricks. The fitted kitchen is located at the front making the most of the additional width, the boiler is in the opposite front corner. The living area at the rear has fully glazed double doors that open onto the rear garden, there is a log burner, our vendor informs us that the lining had been damaged and would require replacing to enable the burner to be used. From the hallway there is access to the fifth bedroom/garden room on this level with an original sash window and a fully glazed door onto the rear garden, there is an ensuite shower/wet room.The rear garden is small for the area at approximately 4.4 X 4.1 metres, it is South facing has paving and abundant planting with a Mediterranean feel, including Olive, Fig, Philadelphus, Jasmine, Honeysuckle, Ornamental Hop, Pyracanthas, Eunomous, clematis and roses.History and PotentialThe vendors have replaced the windows and doors with the exception of one window. In August 1992, tanking works were carried out to the flank wall in the basement. Recently some areas of brickwork on the front have been repointed.Subject to planning permission that observes the conservation area guidelines it could be possible to obtain permission for a mansard roof extension adding another floor of accommodation.Tenure: FreeholdThe Roman Road and Bow NeighbourhoodThis sought after neighbourhood is a thriving, highly desirable and lively place to live, with good schools, beautiful green spaces and a well-known food and drink culture. The excellent transport links provide easy access to the City, Canary Wharf and beyond, making it an ideal location for professionals and families alike.Chisenhale Road and the other Victorian streets of the Driffield Road Conservation area are not only an architectural delight, but they are very friendly and have a strong community feel, and the house is in the catchment area of the popular Chisenhale Primary School.Mile End park and Hertford Union Canal are 2 minutes’ walk away from your door step.Despite the quietness of the immediate locality, the Roman Road and Bow in general, provide bustle and life with a plethora of independent cafes, bars and restaurants to choose from and a variety of convenience stores are at hand. From independent boutiques to well-known high street brands, there is something to suit all tastes and budgets.The famous Roman Road Market offers an eclectic mix of vintage clothing, fresh produce, and artisanal goods, and there is a Sunday food market in the park, with Broadway and the Columbia Road Flower Markets, a 20-minute stroll along the picturesque Regents Canal.Mile End tube station is just a short walk away from where the Central, District, and Hammersmith and City lines can be accessed, providing easy access to all parts of the city.

The area houses many Churches, some still used for worship, many converted to apartments, and some converted for community projects such as The Wynd Centre and pace, as well as other interesting buildings to include the Coats Observatory, Hutcheson School, Peter Brough Home for Nurses and of course the John Neilson Institution.There are a variety of social recreational and transport amenities on your doorstep from this location as well as Paisley Gilmour street station which is 2 minutes away with links to Glasgow and the coastal areas.Entrance HallStorage CupboardOpen Plan Living22'5 x 19'9Bedroom One12'1 x 12'0Bedroom Two10'1 x 8'6Storage RoomBathroom7'3 x 6'2Property Ownership InformationTenureFreeholdCouncil Tax BandCDisclaimer For Virtual ViewingsSome or all information pertaining to this property may have been provided solely by the vendor, and although we always make every effort to verify the information provided to us, we strongly advise you to make further enquiries before continuing.If you book a viewing or make an offer on a property that has had its valuation conducted virtually, you are doing so under the knowledge that this information may have been provided solely by the vendor, and that we may not have been able to access the premises to confirm the information or test any equipment.

Watch the Video Tour!Hiltingbury Infant, Junior and Thornden Secondary School CatchmentThis is an extended, four-bedroom, detached house with both a large driveway and double garage, all sat on a plot exceeding a third of an acre. Well-placed for journeys in and out the area, swift routes onto the M27 & M3 make this area popular amongst commuters. A number of mainline stations sit nearby, providing easy access to Bournemouth, Salisbury and London Waterloo. Further transport links are abundant, with buses available from a number of stops to take you to Eastleigh, Southampton and Winchester. The area is highly requested amongst growing families due to the popular selection of schools nearby. You will be hard pressed to find a better location that ticks this many boxes.A sizeable, gravel driveway leads you towards the front door sheltered by a storm-porch. The entrance hall welcomes you in to the home, with the living room to your left and to your right, a cloakroom, the snug and doorway to the extended rear of the property, comprising utility room, kitchen/dining room and secondary area currently also used for dining. The accommodation to the ground floor is very much versatile and can be adapted to your individual needs quite easily.The perfect entertaining space, the kitchen/Dining Room area looks out in to the rear garden, accessed via folding doors. On a sunny day, the over-head, lantern skylights flood the room with copious amounts of natural light, enhanced throughout the downstairs thanks to the light colour-scheme. The kitchen itself is fitted with all the usual integrated appliances you'd expect, complimented by copious cupboard-space and a large island.Upstairs, the enormous landing leads to the family bathroom and four bedrooms, with the primary benefiting from a walk-in-wardrobe which leads on to a four-piece en-suite. The other bedrooms to the rear of the property are both well proportioned doubles, with a single to the front. There's also a four-piece family bathroom with a large double shower cubicle.The garage is big enough to fit two vehicles and a bit more, with storage above.The outside areas are thoughtfully landscaped, with decking, a patio, and a large lawn area to the rear. The front features a wide range of mature shrubs and bushes, as well as a lawned area and flowers. These gardens really shine in the spring and summer!I anticipate huge demand for this property, so please be quick to book your viewing.

The guide price or range of guide prices is given to assist consumers in deciding whether or not to pursue a purchase. It is usual, but not always the case, that a provisional reserve range is agreed between the seller and the auctioneer at the start of marketing. As the reserve is not fixed at this stage and can be adjusted by the seller at any time up to the day of the auction in the light of interest shown during the marketing period, a guide price is issued. This guide price can be shown in the form of a minimum and maximum price range within which an acceptable sale price (reserve) would fall, or as a single price figure within 10% of which the minimum acceptable price (reserve) would fall. A guide price is different to a reserve price (see separate definition). Both the guide price and the reserve price can be subject to change up to and including the day of the auction.Reserve PriceThe seller’s minimum acceptable price at auction and the figure below which the auctioneer cannot sell.

With a view of a beautiful church spire, the gardens are both extensive and private. Perfect for little ones to roam in safety, and ideal for those with green fingers. There are established lawns with beautiful mature trees, as well as rustic garden areas that offer further potential.There is ample parking, various outbuildings, and small woodland copse's too. Discerning buyers with an additional budget may wish to explore the possibility of extending, or in future years potentially developing the property further, subject to planning permission, but we think it is perfect, just the way it is.Constructed circa 1840 by the Hirst family believed by our clients to have been designed by an Italian architect, he house displays character and charm, and enjoys high ceilings, arched window heads and most of the rooms are double aspect allowing for lots of natural light. The family then went on to build the nearby church at the bottom of the garden in honour of their daughter Mary, and later the Almshouses. Ash cottage is situated in its own private parkland garden on the edge of the Peak District and Pennines.Period fireplaces, deep skirting boards and a lovely hallway add to the stature of the property.There are four bedrooms in total, three being double bedrooms, and one single. In addition, there is a shower room and separate bathroom.The ground floor accommodation is suited to daily life, with a variety of reception rooms allowing for various activities, complemented by the addition of a beautiful sun lounge/garden room looking over the rear patio and beyond.The kitchen has been opened up and has an adjacent morning room, perfect for breakfasting or just daily family interaction. There is a formal dining room and separate drawing room also. One can imagine sitting back and relaxing in front of an open fire, especially on cold winter evenings or Christmas time. Wine and storage cellars provide additional useful space.Approaching Ash Cottage from the driveway one cannot fail to appreciate the beauty of this lovely family home and the setting that it enjoys. It has neighbours, but is private, it is in the countryside, but is so easy to access.Business travellers will appreciate the road links to Manchester, and local buyers will appreciate the extensive amenities on offer across the Holme Valley. There are several local villages with a variety of amenities, independent businesses, places to eat out and socialise, a local golf course within walking distance, public services, bus services, supermarkets and a variety of other activities, including sports and social clubs too. A fabulous location for those who enjoy the outdoors, with cycling, riding and local countryside and scenery all on the doorstep.Buying Ash Cottage is a lifestyle decision, one we think that a discerning buyer will never regret.Viewings are strictly by appointment with James White via our Honley Office.

As the river flows under the former wheel pit, the sound of the flowing water follows you as you enter into a welcoming entrance hall. Through the hall you are greeted by one of the original wooden wallower wheels that adorns the wall as a nod to the property’s past. The ground floor has a thoughtfully designed layout to cater for many types of family dynamics with a clever blend of open plan with clear zoned areas. The living room takes in uninterrupted views of the River Colne with an open fireplace fitted with a log burner creating a warm atmosphere. There is a dining room with exposed timbers and a vaulted ceiling to the first floor and a large second sitting area complete with bar. An enclosed study offers complete privacy for those needing to work from home with views over the river. The kitchen is perfect for those that enjoy culinary pursuits and has been recently renovated to offer a blend of contemporary living with an extensive range of high gloss wall and base units complimented by a quartz worksurface. A breakfast bar provides a pleasant spot to enjoy a coffee and integrated appliances cater for all the everyday needs of a busy home. The utility room offers further space for white goods with a door leading out to the rear garden.As you head up to the staircase you pass the initials of former owners etched into the brickwork, yet another reminder of the rich Heritage of this wonderful property. On the first floor, the property offers a really usable layout with generous bedrooms. The principal bedroom is a stunning space with exposed timbers and wonderful views over open countryside.The principal bedroom has an en-suite and a lovely walk in wardrobe with fitted hanging space. There are four additional bedrooms each enjoying views of countryside and exposed timbers and a luxurious family bathroom fitted with a bath and shower.During the restoration the owners discovered the original steps once used by the mill workers and have carefully restored these for use to access the second floor of the mill. On the second floor is an open landing with vaulted ceiling to exposed roof trusses and would make a lovely seating area for bedroom six which has a high level window allowing for plenty of light to fill the room. A second set of restored steps lead to a loft mezzanine with further steps to a void where there is scope for additional rooms if required. Additional Mill machinery are still located within the loft which would make an interested restoration project for the new owners.The mill is located along a private drive that opens to a wonderful setting of three properties. The attached Mill House is a Georgian residence and complements Chalkney Mill’s façade. Up the lane from the mill is the beautiful ancient woodland of Chalkney Meadows, a favoured spot for locals to enjoy a peaceful stroll through the woodland. The gardens of Chalkney Mill provide a tranquil setting to unwind and enjoy the sounds of the River Colne and visiting wildlife. A patio area extends across the rear of the Mill creating a lovely entertaining area. A gate opens to the formal gardens where you can relax in the summer house. To access the additional acreage, you have to cross the sluice gates, a system that sends water into the picturesque mill pond during times of high water. The mill pond continues to a mill stream that links back to the River Colne further downstream. Once you cross the bridge, you will find two paddocks with a stable block in the second field. In all, the property enjoys around 2.5 acres of private gardens situated in a stunning setting with every changing scenery.Earls Colne is situated in the heart of the Colne Valley which has some of the prettiest countryside in the County with plenty of opportunities for walks and riding.It is well placed for the commuter being within easy reach of Kelvedon Station and Marks Tey stations with the journey to Liverpool Street taking some 50 - 60 minutes. En-route to Kelvedon, one crosses the A120 trunk road which serves Braintree, Dunmow, Stansted Airport and the M11.The market towns of Halstead and Coggeshall are both situated approximately 4 miles away which offer extensive shopping and dining facilities.The region boasts a significant number of secondary and primary schools as well as colleges and nurseries. There are well-renowned private schools within easy reach and some of the country’s leading grammar schools in Colchester and Chelmsford.Electric, Oil, Private Drainage, Mains WaterEntrance HallSitting Room6.53m x 6.23m (21' 5"" x 20' 5"")Living Room & Dining Area8.81m x 8.66m (28' 11"" x 28' 5"")Office3.40m x 3.23m (11' 2"" x 10' 7"")Kitchen/Breakfast Room5.87m x 3.94m (19' 3"" x 12' 11"")Utility Room4.19m x 2.25m (13' 9"" x 7' 5"")Ground Floor CloakroomFirst Floor LandingBedroom One5.08m x 4.48m (16' 8"" x 14' 8"")Walk in Wardrobe2.50m x 1.94m (8' 2"" x 6' 4"")En-SuiteBedroom Two4.97m x 3.30m (16' 4"" x 10' 10"")Bedroom Three3.46m x 3.30m (11' 4"" x 10' 10"")Bedroom Four3.34m x 3.30m (10' 11"" x 10' 10"")Bedroom Five4.32m x 2.42m (14' 2"" x 7' 11"")Family BathroomSecond Floor Landing/Study Area6.48m x 2.46m (21' 3"" x 8' 1"")Bedroom Six6.48m x 2.40m (21' 3"" x 7' 10"")Loft Storage6.48m x 5.07m (21' 3"" x 16' 8"")Agents NotePlease note this property is a listed building meaning it is of local or national historical interest.

Set in a stunning block in Shaftesbury Avenue which runs through the heart of the West End.The PropertyExtending over 736 sq. Ft., this luxury apartment is set on the fourth floor (with lift) and features high ceilings, quality wood flooring and floor to ceiling triple glazed windows which bathes the entire property in natural light. The apartment features a magnificent living room with plenty of entertainment and dining space. There is a partially separated bespoke contemporary kitchen with integrated appliances and stylish décor. The principle bedroom boasts full height fitted wardrobes and an immaculate en-suite bathroom with double sink. Second bedroom which could also be used as a bright office space with sliding doors opening into the reception and a stylish family bathroom. The flat is ideal as an investment, pied de terre or owner occupiers.Property LocationThis beautiful building is very well kept and located within the heart of Covent Garden on Shaftesbury Avenue. Well positioned for access to the capital's best in dining, entertainment and shopping. The apartment also offers easy access to the City of London, airports and to many of the world's best universities.It is a short walk from the Covent Garden Piazza and is very well connected in terms of buses and tubes. The nearest Underground stations are Covent Garden (Piccadilly line), Leicester Square (Northern and Piccadilly lines) and Tottenham Court Road (Central and Northern lines, Elizabeth Line).What the Owner Saysi'm in love with this flat. I first rented in the building and when I noticed this flat was for sale I didn't hesitate. Its hypercentral location at the melting point of Soho and Covent Garden allow me to do most of my commutes walking. But leaving the city is easy as all central underground lines are just a short stroll away, including the just opened Elizabeth Line. For me personally it was especially very easy to access the Eurostar in just a few minutes.As the flat is at the backside of the building it is also remarkably calm for its central location. I really appreciated (and financially support) the community-run garden behind the building.The flat is very bright and even though modern the lighting make it a very cosy home. From the bedroom I especially appreciate the view over 'St Giles in the Fields' church, which indeed still is surrounded by lots of open space.What3words ///  faces.nobody.bleatNoticePlease note we have not tested any apparatus, fixtures, fittings, or services.

The city is steeped in history and features many wonderful Georgian terraced streets which are rivalled only in the west by Bath.
